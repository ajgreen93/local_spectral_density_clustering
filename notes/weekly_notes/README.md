3.13.19.NotesForWeek - attempt to show mixing time over Lipschitz nonconvex set as a function of an isoperimetric inequality (shown) and local conductance (not shown)

3.20.19.NotesForWeek - improves previous weeks notes by showing local conductance bound

4.8.19.NotesForWeek - includes references to several papers showing gamma convergence + precompactness of the TV functional.

4.12.19.NotesForWeek - proves a lower bound for the graph conductance function.

4.27.19.NotesForWeek - upper bounds the ratio of volume of expanded sets, using first principles and no reference to Lipschitz images.

5.11.19.NotesForWeek - shows an alternative method for upper bound TV mixing time based on conductance and local spread; conversion from TV to uniform mixing time for lazy random walk is appropriately handled.
